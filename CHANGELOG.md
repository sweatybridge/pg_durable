# Changelog

Pre-1.0 note: while `pg_durable` is in major version `0`, minor releases may include breaking changes.

## v0.2.0 (in development)

- Breaking change: `df.vars` now uses per-user scoping via RLS. After upgrading from `v0.1.1`, all pre-existing variables are re-homed to the role that ran `ALTER EXTENSION pg_durable UPDATE`; other users will lose access to any variables they had set before the upgrade.
- Security: harden SQL execution against injection (#51)
- Fix: `is_truthy` now correctly treats "false", "no", and "f" as falsy (#57)
- Docs: add "Debugging Failed Workflows" section to User Guide (#71)
- New: Azure Functions integration example (#69)
